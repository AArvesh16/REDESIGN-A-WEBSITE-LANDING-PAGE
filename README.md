DESCRIPTION

**Redesign of IRCTC Landing Page: A UI/UX Case Study**

The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website is one of the most widely used platforms in India for booking train tickets, checking PNR status, and accessing travel services. However, the current landing page has several usability issues, such as cluttered UI, slow booking process, and complex navigation, leading to user frustration.

To improve the overall experience, I took the initiative to redesign the IRCTC landing page using Figma with a focus on better user experience, accessibility, and a visually appealing modern UI. My goal was to create a simplified, responsive, and intuitive design that enhances the efficiency of ticket booking while maintaining a professional and trustworthy look.

**How I Created the Redesign**

1. **Research & Problem Identification**

Before starting the redesign, I conducted user research to identify pain points. This included:

Analyzing existing issues such as cluttered UI, slow booking flow, and lack of clear CTAs (Call-to-Action).
Studying competitor platforms like MakeMyTrip, RedBus, and Goibibo to understand best practices in travel booking UX.
Gathering user feedback from real IRCTC users regarding their challenges in booking train tickets.

Based on the research, I identified three major areas of improvement:

 Simplifying the booking process with a clear step-by-step flow.
 Decluttering the homepage by prioritizing essential information.
 Enhancing mobile responsiveness for a seamless experience across devices.

2. **Wireframing & Prototyping in Figma**
Once the problems were identified, I started with low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to map out the new layout. The goal was to create a clean and user-friendly interface that allows users to:

Quickly search for trains using an intuitive form.
Check PNR status, bookings, and offers without navigating through multiple pages.
Access important services like Tatkal bookings and train schedules with ease.
After refining the wireframes, I moved to high-fidelity prototypes, ensuring proper alignment, spacing, typography, and color schemes to improve readability and engagement.

3. **Tools & Technologies Used**

To execute the redesign effectively, I used:

 Figma: For designing wireframes, prototypes, and UI components.
 Google Material Design Guidelines: To ensure consistency in UI elements.
 Unsplash & Icons8: For royalty-free images and icons.
 Contrast & Accessibility Checkers: To maintain WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) for color contrast and readability.

4. **Features & Improvements in the Redesign**

Simplified Navigation:

A more organized menu bar with quick links to train bookings, PNR status, and FAQs.
Hamburger menu for better mobile accessibility.

 Modern UI & Visual Appeal:

Minimalist design with better spacing, typography, and an easy-to-read color scheme.
High-contrast buttons for accessibility.
 Improved Booking Flow:

A single-step train search form (From â€“ To, Date, Class, etc.) to reduce user effort.
An optimized Tatkal booking feature for faster access.

Mobile-First Approach:

Ensured full responsiveness with a mobile-friendly layout.
Adaptive elements that work on different screen sizes.

5. **Where This Redesign is Applicable**

The redesigned IRCTC landing page can be used in multiple ways:

Official Implementation: If adopted by IRCTC, this design can significantly improve user experience.
UI/UX Portfolio Case Study: Demonstrates my problem-solving and design skills for real-world applications.
Similar Booking Platforms: The UX principles used can be applied to bus, flight, and hotel booking websites to enhance their efficiency.

6. **Challenges & Learnings**
During this project, I faced challenges like:

Ensuring complex information is presented in a simple and engaging way.
Maintaining brand identity while introducing modern design elements.
Testing different layouts to optimize usability.
This redesign helped me strengthen my UI/UX skills, including visual hierarchy, responsive design, and usability testing. It also gave me a deeper understanding of user behavior in travel booking applications.

**Official Implementation** :

 IRCTC can adopt this design to enhance its current platform.
Case Study for UI/UX Roles: Demonstrates my ability to solve real-world problems.
Travel & Booking Platforms: The principles used can improve similar websites like airline, hotel, and bus booking platforms.

Conclusion

Through this project, I successfully created a clean, modern, and user-friendly IRCTC landing page redesign that enhances usability and improves the booking experience. By leveraging Figma, user research, and modern design principles, I transformed a complex interface into a streamlined and efficient platform.
This case study is a strong example of my ability to analyze problems, design intuitive solutions, and implement best UX practices to improve digital products.
